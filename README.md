<h2> About Me: </h2>

I'm currently pursuing  __Masters__  in __Data Analytics__ from __San Jose State University__,Department of Applied Data Science. I have 4.5 years of experience in data modelling and data analysis. In addition to this, I completed courses such as __Machine Learning Fundamentals__, __Natural Language Processing(NLP)__, __Deep Learning__, __Big Data__ and __Statistics__ from DataCamp, GeekForGeeks, Coursera and Udemy. These courses were influential in my theoretical understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and data science. To gain hands on experience, I worked on projects ranging from __retail__,__banking__,__movies__ and __automobile__ industries.   
I am always eager to learn and expand my knowledge in these fields, and I have a passion for using data and technology to make a positive impact. My portfolio on GitHub showcases a selection of my projects and experiences, and demonstrates my capabilities as a data science and machine learning professional.Whether it's through building predictive models or developing data pipelines, I am dedicated to using my skills to drive innovation and solve complex problems. I am excited to share my work with others and contribute to the data science and machine learning community. Thank you for considering my portfolio.ðŸ™‚


<h2>:wrench: :carpentry_saw: My Skills:</h2>
  
I started learning python in my first semester which helped to understand data science and machine learning.I also learned R language which is one of the important languages in statistics and machine learning. Below is a list of skills that I have gained through my experience in the field of data science and machine learning. Learning these essential skills and techniques helped me to built and deployed projects successfully.
